## Svelte
Svelte is a modern front-end framework for building web applications. 
Unlike traditional frameworks like React or Vue, which use a virtual DOM, Svelte shifts much of the work to the build step. 
It compiles your components into highly efficient, plain JavaScript code that updates the DOM directly. 
This results in faster performance and smaller bundle sizes.
