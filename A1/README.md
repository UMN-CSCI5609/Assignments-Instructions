## Preparation
- Ensure you have a code IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed. While you are welcome to use any IDE of your choice, this course will assume the use of VSCode for demonstrations.
- [Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) on your machine.
- Ensure that you have a github account [how to register](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)
- Make sure you have [Git installed on your computer](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Have a Chrome Web Browser

## Preliminary Knowledge: HTML+JS+CSS

This class assumes you have basic knowledge of web development. However, here's a quick refresher to jog your memory.

In your VSCode, create an `index.html` file as the one shown above.

Open it in your chrome browser and you will see a webpage like below. Please the button will change the shwoing number of clicks.

Modify the webpage to refresh your memory:
1. [modify the style] change the background color of the button to `#44aa66`, modify the button font size to  `font-size: xx-large`
2. [modift the webpage content] as shown below
3. [modify the function] Display the remaining number of clicks.
After 5 clicks, show an alert: "No more clicks remaining!".

## Svelte
Svelte is a modern front-end framework for building web applications. 
Unlike traditional frameworks like React or Vue, which use a virtual DOM, Svelte shifts much of the work to the build step. 
It compiles your components into highly efficient, plain JavaScript code that updates the DOM directly. 
This results in faster performance and smaller bundle sizes.

SvelteKit provides an easy way to start a Svelte Project.
In your terminal, find a location you like to save the project, and run `npx sv create my-vis-5609` 
(You can name it whatever you prefer, but we will assume `my-vis-5609` as the folder name for following demonstration)
