First, using the provided code, fill the blank to get the data dashboard as shown in the demo
(3 Points)

Second, reflect the design of the dashboard (no implementation needed, 4 points):

1. why do we use opacity = 0.5 for points in the scatter plot, what will happen if all points default transparency is 1
2. what are the other potential visual encoding that can be used in th 
3. In the current implementation, all attributes can be binded with the three visual channels, and can lead to inappropriate encodings, e.g., using x axis for the title of 895 movies. Which attribute should removed from the dropdown list of each channel.
4. I use line chart for the the year distribution to showcase how to implement line chart. But is line chart the best choice here?

with the data dashboard,
we will do an exploratory analysis, which factors will influence the average rates of a summer movies.
First consider three potential factors, and then use your visual analysis to either support or reject them with screenshot of the visualization.
For the three discussed factors, at least one should influence the rating.
